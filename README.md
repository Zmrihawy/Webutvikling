# prosjekt4

## Overview
The main aim of this project was to create a mobile application for our online catalog created in project 3
with React Native.

## Project structure
Our project build is based on two parts, a client part and a server part. The server part is basically the same as the previouse project which contains all the necessary REST API implementations needed for fetching data from the backend and the client part contains the frontend "user-based" actions like searching for an item, showing items, filtering and sorting of items.
